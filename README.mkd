# CoreX

A bunch of different extensions that I use throughout other Ruby libraries. Feel 
free to fork and add your own in there. 

## Using

You can require lib/corex.rb to get all the extensions, or just load what you 
need.

## Contribute

Would love if others add in their core extensions that they use often. So, if 
you are inclined, make a fork, add your stuff and submit a pull request.

Thanks!
